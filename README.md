Welcome to my yet-to-be named flac player.
The intention for this application is to be able to rip flac files from your cd collection and play them natively.

Instructions: 
-
1. Set up your file structure: Directory > Artist Names Here > Album Names Here.
2. Rip your files. I use EAC (Easy Audio Copy), with the MusicBrainz Metadata Plugin for metadata. (You will want metadata to show images). My EAC profile is under resources.com.berrygobbler78.flacplayer. Use the format: track#. title - artist.flac . 
3. Run the app and select your base directory. You can change it later in the settings.
5. When you add more songs, you should reload the app and it should generate any missing images.
6. Enjoy.

Future things to do:
- 
- Make colors customizable
- Shuffling
- Media controls (volume, speed)
- Playlists
